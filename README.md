# Duplicate Question Detector

A complete NLP-based pipeline to detect whether two questions are duplicates. Inspired by the Quora Question Pair challenge, this project began with basic ML logic and gradually evolved into a robust BiLSTM deep learning model with Streamlit frontend and clean data preprocessing.

## Overview

The goal is to predict if two given questions are semantically similar. This helps platforms like Quora avoid duplicate content and improve user search experience.

## How the Project Evolved

| Phase | Approach | Key Milestone |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| ðŸ”¹ Phase 1 | **Rule-Based Baseline** | Handcrafted logic using word overlap, Jaccard similarity |
| ðŸ”¹ Phase 2 | **TF-IDF + ML Models** | Implemented Logistic Regression, XGBoost, improved accuracy |
| ðŸ”¹ Phase 3 | **Word2Vec + ML** | Used pre-trained GloVe vectors for better semantic capture |
| ðŸ”¹ Phase 4 | **BiLSTM Deep Learning** | Built using Keras for superior performance on text sequences |
| ðŸ”¹ Phase 5 | **Streamlit App** | UI for real-time predictions |
| ðŸ”¹ Phase 6 | **Deployment Attempts** | Faced and overcame Python/TensorFlow version issues |

## ðŸ”¬ Modeling Approaches

### 1. Baseline (Manual Logic)
- Jaccard similarity
- Common word count
- Heuristic rules

### 2. TF-IDF + ML
- `TfidfVectorizer` on both questions
- Concatenation, difference, cosine similarity
- Trained: Logistic Regression, RandomForest, XGBoost

### 3. Word2Vec + ML
- Loaded GloVe embeddings
- Averaged word vectors
- Distance-based features (cosine, Manhattan, Euclidean)

### 4. Deep Learning (BiLSTM)
- Tokenized & padded sequences
- Model:
  - Embedding â†’ BiLSTM â†’ Dense
- Trained with Binary Crossentropy & Adam optimizer
